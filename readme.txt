## Top Features 🤘

### 1️⃣ FLAWLESS NAVIGATION
With SmartDocs built-in templates, you can quickly set up Documentation and organize them using *categories* for users to start navigating them easily.

### 2️⃣ POWERFUL SEARCH OPTION 
SmartDocs comes with a powerful search that will allow customers to navigate the doc based on the entered keywords. The search also supports other post types like posts and pages to show up in the search results. All easily adjustable via settings in one click. 

### 3️⃣ BUILT-IN-STYLING & CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS
We understand the hassle of going through CSS and the painstaking time it takes to build beautiful designs. Hence, we have build styling controls right in the Native Customizer.

With our built-in customizer controls, you can set colors, background colors, font-sizes, etc., for built-in templates right from the customizer. Not to mention with **Live Preview.**

### 4️⃣ GET QUICK FEEDBACK
Getting feedback from the customers is an essential part of the Documentation. SmartDocs provides built-in functionality for customers to rate docs as helpful or not helpful. This not only allows them to provide quality feedback but also helps you to understand if the content is serving the purpose or not.

### 5️⃣ CUSTOM BREAKPOINTS
Good Documentation should be accessible from every device, and SmartDocs understand it undoubtedly.

It is fully responsive and works perfectly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. You can even set custom breakpoints for your Documentation in the customizer settings if required. 

### 6️⃣ DEVELOPER FRIENDLY
*Do you like to fiddle with the code?*
We definitely do 😉 While managing Documentation for our existing plugins, we know how frustrating it can be for developers to change or modify simple things in code. Hence, we have researched and analyzed the plugins' code design from a developer's perspective to keep the code developer-friendly.

*Rewrite, Modify, or Customize; whatever you want to do, you'll find a way in SmartDocs to do it.*
